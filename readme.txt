== Upgrade Notice ==

This is a major update of this plugin, all widgets are re-coded to use SiteOrigin's API properly and removed dependency of Titan framework. By updating it you will loss some old working widgets and will need to re-add them to make them work. However all widgets are same as previous. Other than that updating is a smooth transition, but it's always better to have a backup first.
